## 13.1 Introduction

- R’s first and simplest OO system
- Only OO system used in the base and stats packages
- Most commonly used system in CRAN packages
- Very flexible
- S3 has no checks for correctness

.footnote[Make sure to check out the package vctrs (https://vctrs.r-lib.org).]

---

## 13.2 Basics

What are the requirements for S3 objects?

--

- a `class` attribute.

--

A simple example, a `factor`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
f <- factor(c("a", "b", "c"))

typeof(f)
attributes(f)
```

.footnote[Drop the `class` attribute with the command `unclass`.]

---

## 13.2 Basics (2)

So, what makes these S3 objects special?

--

When passed to a __generic__ (function), they have different behaviour than base objects.

--

For example, `print`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
print(f)

print(unclass(f))
```

---

## 13.2 Basics (3)

How can you find out if a function is `generic`?

--

```
sloop::ftype
```

--

For example,
```{r, eval = TRUE}
sloop::ftype(print)
sloop::ftype(unclass)
```

---

", width = "400px")
```
]

.pull-right[
You can track the method dispatch process with
```
sloop::s3_dispatch()
```

For example:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
sloop::s3_dispatch(print(f))
```
]

.footnote[⚠️ You should never call the method directly, but instead rely on the generic to find it for you.]

---

### 13.2.1 Exercises

1. Describe the difference between `t.test()` and `t.data.frame()`. When is each function called?

2. Make a list of commonly used base R functions that contain `.` in their name but are not S3 methods.

3. What does the `as.data.frame.data.frame()` method do? Why is it confusing? How could you avoid this confusion in your own code?

4. Describe the difference in behaviour in these two calls.
  ```{r}
  set.seed(1014)
  some_days <- as.Date("2017-01-31") + sample(10, 5)
  
  mean(some_days)
  mean(unclass(some_days))
  ```

5. What class of object does the following code return? What base type is it built on? What attributes does it use?
  ```{r}
  x <- ecdf(rpois(100, 10))
  x
  ```

<!-- 6. What class of object does the following code return? What base type is it built on? What attributes does it use? -->
```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- table(rpois(100, 5))
```

---

## 13.3 Classes

Two ways to create an S3 object:

.pull-left[
```{r}
# Create and assign class in one step
x <- structure(list(), 
               class = "my_class")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
# Create, then set class
x <- list()
class(x) <- "my_class"
```
]

Two handy ways to check an object's class:
```{r}
class(x)

inherits(x, "my_class")
```

.footnote[⚠️ R doesn't stop you from shooting yourself in the foot, but as long as you don’t aim the gun at your toes and pull the trigger, you won’t have a problem.]

---

## 13.3 Classes (2)
.pull-left[
![:scale 100%](https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2798222/792x879/flatten;scale;jpeg_quality=100)
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = TRUE}
# Create a linear model
mod <- lm(log(mpg) ~ log(disp), 
          data = mtcars)
class(mod)
print(mod)

# Why?
class(mod) <- "pikachu"
```
]

---

## 13.3 Classes (3)

To avoid "awkward" situations, Hadley recommends having the following three things:

- A low-level constructor, `new_myclass()`.

- A validator, `validate_myclass()`.

- A user-friendly helper, `myclass()`.

.footnote[⚠️ ... you should always provide a constructor.]

---

## 13.3 Classes (4): Constructors

```{r, eval = TRUE}
new_difftime <- function(x = double(), units = "secs") {
  stopifnot(is.double(x))
  units <- match.arg(units, c("secs", "mins", "hours", "days", "weeks"))

  structure(x,
    class = "difftime",
    units = units
  )
}

new_difftime(10, "secs")

new_difftime(52, "weeks")
```

.footnote[⚠️ ... avoid potentially time-consuming checks in the constructor.]

---

## 13.3 Classes (5): Validators

```{r}
validate_factor <- function(x) {
  values <- unclass(x)
  levels <- attr(x, "levels")

  if (!all(!is.na(values) & values > 0)) {
    stop("All `x` values must be non-missing and greater than zero",
         call. = FALSE)
  }
  if (length(levels) < max(values)) {
    stop("There must be at least as many `levels` as possible values in `x`",
         call. = FALSE)
  }
  x
}
```

---

## 13.3 Classes (6): Helpers
```{r}
# Coerce input to a double
difftime <- function(x = double(), units = "secs") {
  x <- as.double(x)
  new_difftime(x, units = units)
}

# Guess levels from unique values
factor <- function(x = character(), levels = unique(x)) {
  ind <- match(x, levels)
  validate_factor(new_factor(ind, levels))
}

# Allow users to supply individual components for complex types
POSIXct <- function(year = integer(), 
                    month = integer(), 
                    day = integer(), 
                    hour = 0L, 
                    minute = 0L, 
                    sec = 0, 
                    tzone = "") {
  ISOdatetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, sec, tz = tzone)
}
```

---

### 13.3.4 Exercises

1. Write a constructor for `data.frame` objects. What base type is a data frame built on? What attributes does it use? What are the restrictions placed on the individual elements? What about the names?

2. Enhance my `factor()` helper to have better behaviour when one or more values is not found in levels. What does `base::factor()` do in this situation?

3. Carefully read the source code of `factor()`. What does it do that my constructor does not?

4. Factors have an optional “contrasts” attribute. Read the help for `C()`, and briefly describe the purpose of the attribute. What type should it have? Rewrite the `new_factor()` constructor to include this attribute.

5. Read the documentation for `utils::as.roman()`. How would you write a constructor for this class? Does it need a validator? What might a helper do?

---

## 13.4 Generics and methods

How is the method dispatchment performed?

<!-- (images/spongebob.jpg) -->
]

--

__No__! Well, sort of. Every generic calls `UseMethod()`.


.footnote[⚠️You don’t pass any of the arguments of the generic to `UseMethod()`; it uses deep magic to pass to the method automatically.]

---

## 13.4 Generics and methods (2)

`UseMethod()` takes two arguments:

1. __(required)__ the name of the generic function

2. (optional) the argument to use for method dispatch

--

A simple generic:

```{r}
my_new_generic <- function(x) {
  UseMethod("my_new_generic")
}
```

But, how does it work?

--

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x <- structure(list(), class = "pikachu")
paste0("generic", ".", c(class(x), "default"))
``` 

.footnote[⚠️ The “default” class is a special pseudo-class.]

---

## 13.4 Generics and methods (3): Finding methods

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = TRUE}
sloop::s3_methods_generic("mean")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval = TRUE}
sloop::s3_methods_class("ordered")
```
]

---

## 13.4 Generics and methods (4): Creating methods

Before you start creating your own methods:

1. You should only ever write a method if you own the generic or the class.

2. A method must have the same arguments as its generic.

---

### 13.4.4 Exercises

1. Read the source code for `t()` and `t.test()` and confirm that `t.test()` is an S3 generic and not an S3 method. What happens if you create an object with class test and call `t()` with it? Why?
  ```{r}
  x <- structure(1:10, class = "test")
  t(x)
  ```

2. What generics does the table class have methods for?

3. What generics does the ecdf class have methods for?

4. Which base generic has the greatest number of defined methods?

5. Carefully read the documentation for `UseMethod()` and explain why the following code returns the results that it does. What two usual rules of function evaluation does `UseMethod()` violate?

  ```{r}
  g <- function(x) {
    x <- 10
    y <- 10
    UseMethod("g")
  }
  g.default <- function(x) c(x = x, y = y)
  ```
<!-- 6. What are the arguments to `[`? Why is this a hard question to answer? -->

---
class:: inverse, center, middle

# Demo

---

## 13.5 Object styles

- __Vector:__ `Date`, `factor`, etc.
```{r}
f <- factor(c("a", "b", "c")) 
length(f) # 3
```

- __Record:__ Based on lists.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x <- as.POSIXlt(ISOdatetime(2020, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1:3))
x
```

- __Data frames:__ 2D records.

```{r}
x <- data.frame(x = 1:100, y = 1:100)
length(x) # 2
```

- __Scalar:__ `lm`

---

### 13.5.1 Exercises

1. Categorise the objects returned by `lm()`, `factor()`, `table()`, `as.Date()`, `as.POSIXct()`, `ecdf()`, `ordered()`, `I()` into the styles described above.

2. What would a constructor function for `lm` objects, `new_lm()`, look like? Use `?lm` and experimentation to figure out the required fields and their types.

---

## 13.6 Inheritance

- The `class` can be a character vector.

- If a method is not found for the class in the first element of the vector, R looks for a method for the second class (and so on).

- A method can delegate work by calling `NextMethod()`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
sloop::s3_dispatch(print(ordered("x")))
sloop::s3_dispatch(ordered("x")[1])
```

---

## 13.6 Inheritance (2)

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
DiagrammeR::mermaid("
graph LR
A[sub-class]-->B[super-class]
C[ordered]-->D[factor]
", height = "250px")
```
]

.pull-right[
Good to keep in mind:

- The base type of the subclass should be the same as the superclass.

- The attributes of the subclass should be a superset of the attributes of the superclass.

]

--

For example,

```{r}
class(s) <- c("TA", "student")
```

Instead of

```{r}
class(s) <- c("student", "TA")
```

---

## 13.6 Inheritance (3): `NextMethod()`

```{r, eval = TRUE}
new_secret <- function(x = double()) {
  stopifnot(is.double(x))
  structure(x, class = "secret")
}

print.secret <- function(x, ...) {
  print(strrep("x", nchar(x)))
  invisible(x)
}

x <- new_secret(c(15, 1, 456))
x
```

---

## 13.6 Inheritance (4): `NextMethod()`

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# The problem
sloop::s3_dispatch(x[1])
x[1]

# The solution
`[.secret` <- function(x, i) {
  new_secret(NextMethod())
}
x[1]
```

---

## 13.6 Inheritance (5): Subclassing:

```{r}
new_secret <- function(x, ..., class = character()) {
  stopifnot(is.double(x))

  structure(
    x,
    ...,
    class = c(class, "secret")
  )
}
```

---

## 13.7 Dispatch details

What happens when you call an S3 generic with a base object, i.e. an object with no class?

--

```{r}
s3_dispatch(print(matrix(1:5)))
```

---

## 13.7 Dispatch details (2): Group generics

There are four group generics:

- __Math:__ abs(), sign(), sqrt(), floor(), cos(), sin(), log(), and more (see ?Math for the complete list).

- __Ops:__ +, -, *, /, ^, %%, %/%, &, |, !, ==, !=, <, <=, >=, and >.

- __Summary:__ all(), any(), sum(), prod(), min(), max(), and range().

- __Complex:__ Arg(), Conj(), Im(), Mod(), Re().

---

## 13.7 Dispatch details (3): Double dispatch

`<object with class A>` + `object with class B>`

The output should be equal to

`<object with class B>` + `object with class A>`

How does it work then?

--

__Double dispatch__, the type of both objects is used.

---

## 13.7 Dispatch details (4): Double dispatch

Possible outcomes:

- The methods are the same, so it doesn’t matter which method is used.

- The methods are different, and R falls back to the internal method with a warning.

- One method is internal, in which case R calls the other method.

---

class: inverse, center, middle
